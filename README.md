# DeepLearning.AI-Vector-Databases-from-Embeddings-to-Applications

I'd like to share my journey through DeepLearning.AI's Course "Vector Databases from Embeddings to Applications" course repository, built in partnership with Weaviate. This repository contains all the necessary files and resources for the course.

## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of AI, enabling the creation of many new and exciting applications. However, LLMs have limitations, such as a lack of knowledge about recent events or proprietary documents not included in their training data. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) addresses this issue by leveraging a vector database to store proprietary or recent data. When a query is made, the vector database retrieves related text data, which is then used to provide context to the LLM for generating a response.

Vector databases are not only crucial for RAG but have also been integral to semantic search applications and recommender systems. Understanding the inner workings of vector databases will empower AI developers to use them more effectively in their projects.

## Course Overview

By the end of this course, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of vector databases, including:

- How vector databases work and what goes on under the hood.
- When to apply sparse search, dense search, or hybrid search.
- Choosing the best distance algorithm for similarity calculations.
- The challenges of scaling vector databases and selecting embedding search algorithms.


## Repository Structure

In this repository, you'll find various notebooks that I have go over and ran as part of this course, located in the src/ directory. While traveling through the course, I used these notebooks to learn, practice, and internalize the concepts about vector databases and search.

Below is the structure of this repository, which includes the source code, Jupyter notebooks, and other resources used throughout the course.

| File/Folder Name                                    | Type     | Description |
